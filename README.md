_re**di**rection pr**oxy**_

It's an HTTP proxy which ensures that you're always
using the HTTPS version of a site whenever one is
available. The currently supported sites are:

* Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikibooks, Wikiquote,
  Wikisource, Wikinews, and Wikiversity
* Google Search
* YouTube
* Twitter

The redirection mechanism is currently monolithic, but
I might make it fancier in the future.
